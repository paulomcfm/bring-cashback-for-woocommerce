## WHAT’S INCLUDED IN OUR FREE POINTS AND REWARDS FOR WOOCOMMERCE PLUGIN

**1) User Level & Badges**: The Points and Rewards plugin is designed for customer engagement and loyalty! Admins can now motivate customers to earn reward points through various activities by awarding unique user badges. These badges represent different levels of achievement. The admins have full control over their position and level names. They can also set the milestone threshold for customers to reach their desired level with ease, and reward point values that the customers will get. 

Plus, we understand the importance of aesthetics. Merchants can easily customize badge images to align with their brand. It's a powerful, flexible, and visually appealing way to boost customer loyalty!
 
NOTE: The merchants can only add two user levels in the free version. The pro version on the other hand offers unlimited user levels and badge kinds.

**2) Gamification Settings**: The WooCommerce rewards plugin now enables merchants to make their websites more engaging and interesting with gamification settings. After enabling the settings your customers will get a chance to spin the “win-wheel” and earn rewards and points. The settings of this feature are completely dynamic. The merchants will be able to fully customize the win-wheel. Admins take the reins! Tailor your win-wheel down to the last detail: choose positions, colors, and segments, and set the loyalty points for each section. Craft an experience that's uniquely yours. Decide whether customers can spin freely or implement cooldown periods. Keep the engagement level just right for your audience. 

After the enhancement, the guest users can also see the wheel but will have to log in to be awarded the WooCommerce loyalty points. 

**3) Restrict Rewards Points**: With this feature of the WooCommerce loyalty program plugin, merchants can restrict customers from earning reward points on the purchase of products that the customers have bought by redeeming their existing reward points.  

**4) Assign Woo Points on Previous Orders**: With the WooCommerce Rewards points plugin, the merchants get a chance to assign Woo points on previous orders. For example, before installing the points and rewards plugin, there might be a lot of orders that customers might be involved with. This setting enables the merchants to assign points to those orders.    

**5) Order Reward Points**: With the WooCommerce point reward system, the admin can select the maximum number of orders for the customers to earn a certain number of points. For example, if the admin has set the maximum number of orders to 10 and the number of points to 5. Then, the customer will earn 5 points, after successfully ordering 10 times from the website. 

**6) WooCommerce Rewards Points on Actions**: With WooCommerce Points and Rewards plugin, customers have the opportunity to earn points for rewards through various activities like:

* **Sign Up**: Merchants can offer points on unique customer sign-ups.
* **Referrals**: When user A shares his referral link and user B signs up using user A’s referral link, user A receives reward points. With this plugin, users can share their referral link on Facebook, Twitter, Email, and WhatsApp directly from their account.
* **Total Amount Spent**: Merchants can set the WooCommerce loyalty points for rewards to be credited to the customer’s account against each penny they spend on their store via the conversion feature.
* **On Purchase Of Product**: Merchants can assign global WooCommerce points and rewards value to all simple products of their store so the customer gets the same number of points on the purchase of any product.
* **On A Set Range Of Order Total**:The merchant can set the number of rewards and points the customer will get if his order value lies within a set range.
.

**7) Easy Woo Points Redemption**: In the WooCommerce loyalty program plugin, customers can redeem their Woo points either on the cart or at the checkout page by entering the points in the “Apply Points” field. Merchant can select where he wants to show the “Apply Points” field, on a cart or at the checkout page. He can also set the conversion rule to determine the value of points and rewards using the conversion table feature.

**For Example:** If the order costs $20 and the customer has 10 points in his account, the merchant can determine whether the customer will get a discount of 10, 5, or 2 dollars by redeeming those 10 points.

**8) Membership System For Exclusive Offers**: Merchants can create their own membership system based on the WooCommerce Loyalty Program plugin. This helps them to offer exclusive discounts to customers based on the loyalty points they collect. Merchants can add WooCommerce reward discounts on some categories and their products. If the customer subscribes to the membership, he can purchase those discounted products. Merchants can grant exclusive WooCommerce points based on membership levels.

**9) WooCommerce Points Log Report**: In the WooCommerce rewards plugin, the WooCommerce points Log Report feature is available for both customers and the admin:

* **For Customers–** They can check and monitor each point transaction they have done so far. The log table shows the details for each point they earned and redeemed.
* **For Merchants–** They can view the user points history to track the points transaction for each customer. Along with it, they can add or deduct points from any customer’s account using this feature.
